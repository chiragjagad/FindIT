# FindIT
A hackathon project to find lost items. I and two of my friends developed an admin portal for the organizations. The admins can do verification of the lost items and give the lost items to the rightful owners. Key features include Chatbox and Basic analysis. The admin portal is built using React and Firebase. The app for this project is made by my friend using Flutter.
